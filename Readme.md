##JoJpeg Addons
This is a collection of usefull little addons for blender, usually its single file addons.
Most of the code is AI generated but I use those addons in my daily life and they should work fine. 

Current addons:
- [Preview World to Render](preview_world_to_render/Readme.md) - Copy the currently active world in the material-preview to your world so that you can use it in rendering.

- [Focus Similar F-Curves](focus_similar_fcurves/Readme.md) - Select all f-curves that are similar to the currently active f-curve. eg all curves named "X-Location". Also if you have more than one curve selected.
